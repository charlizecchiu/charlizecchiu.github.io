                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Something I learned from this article is that demos of prototypes can
                                enhance the product. For example, the pointer that represented the actions
                                in each design had a little animation, which I think added to the appeal of the 
                                design. The animation of the demos as well, such as zooming into certain aspects of the product,
                                helped enhance and make it more interactive/immersive. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article were the animated gifs, especially those
                                featuring products that weren't static. Some of them involved animation, whether it was
                                highlighting certain parts of the product, or the animation of the cursor itself.
                                Those were much more engaging than the ones that were just on a still mockup.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> One of my favorites were "Selected Works Transitions Experiments by Zhenya Rynzhuk for Sochnik
                                ."  It displayed a lot of the images in an elegant and cohesive manner, and the animations 
                                resembled pixels to me, which kind of is a play on the image itself. I also liked Travel Map, and the little
                                animation when the words were broken apart after being searched. However, I felt a lot of the design
                                choices were unneccesary and more for visual appeal. I also liked AI power assistant and the 
                                animation onto the 3D map, and I think that would be something interesting to incorporate to Travel Map.  </p>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> 9, I enjoyed this article because it was very short, simple, and only had visuals.
                                The inspiration designs were helpful and provided something refreshing to look at it, but it's personally
                                not my design style or something I'd like to replicate.  </p>
