						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something interesting I learned from this article is that
								animations have an optimal duration to be displayed, depending on the 
								size of the object as well as the size of the device. I didn't realize before
								that when coding these animations, you had to account for these cross-platform differences.
								I also found it interesting that there's a bit of math involved in making animations
								appear smooth, and that the ease-in / ease-out curves use a specific function.
							 </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was the animated gifs. The visuals 
								made the concept much more easier to understand, and it was a great supplement
								since the reading is more text heavy/dense. They were very simple and 
								helped demonstrate some of the animation guidelines they were talking about. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Numerous researches have discovered that optimal speed for interface animation is between 200 and 500 ms." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> 8 - It was a bit long, but it provided a lot of useful information about web design animation in one place.</p>
