						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from this article is when choosing type, you have
								to research your target audience thoroughly. Some fonts/types are more suitable
								certain age demographics, such as fonts that are easier to read for children
								or more clear for the elderly. It's also important that when you choose font pairings that
								they appear cohesive and visually appealing. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the resources and the links they provided.
								The images were great visual aids as well, but putting down links to get font inspiration, 
								font pairing websites, are trusted places seems very helpful for the reader. I also liked 
								that they included Chrome web extensions you can use to identify fonts as well. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Typography can make or break a design.

								There's a beauty and complexity to typography. " </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> 7.5 - It touched on a lot of things that I already know with graphic design
								experience so it was a bit repeptitive, but I can see this being a great resource to beginners!
								I also do appreciate how many resources they linked throughout the article. </p>
