						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from this article is that psychology and the Gestalt principles
								can be utilized in design. They can be especially useful in product/UI/UX design, in terms
								of solving problems and thinking about human-centered design. In thinking about how the user will
								navigate a product, it's equally important to think about their psychology and how it will function/react 
								while interacting with an interface, and how we can mold it using these principles. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article were the images demonstrating the properties that were
								being explained. I like to see things visually demonstrated and explained, so the graphic 
								of the world Gestalt was nice breaking down each principle. I also liked the clouds and 
								how they related to how we see the world and perceive them as shapes as humans, and I felt that
								was very relatable.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "[Gestalt] is built on the theory that 'an organized whole, is perceived as greater than the sum of its parts.'" </p>
						</li>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> 7, this article was interesting to read but a little bit dense, and I already knew most of these 
								from taking psych classes before. </p>
