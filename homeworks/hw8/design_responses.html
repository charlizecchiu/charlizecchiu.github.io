				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Something I learned from this article is that LinkedIn actually got sued
							because of design malpractices. I never really heard of companies being held responsible
							for their design actions and actually have them challenged, especially concerning
							with spam emails. It's nice that so early on a lawsuit was filed with a $13 million penalty
							so other companies have a warning to not follow their steps.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I liked the part of the article that talked about the 11 different dark patterns.
							The examples provided with the images of each tactic was very useful and informative. 
							I also liked being able to recognize some of the patterns I've come across on the web. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "As Steve Fisher at the Generate NY 2017 conference said,
							“Find a way to help the vulnerable around you. If you have privilege, use it for good.”" </p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a
							five, please briefly explain why.</p>
						<p> 7, I enjoyed reading about dark patterns as I wasn't really aware of this concept before,
							but the reading was just a bit lengthy. </p>
