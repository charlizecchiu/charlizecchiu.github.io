    <ul> 
        <li> In this article, I learned that product designers make
        deliberate decisions centered around the user's thinking while designing a 
        product, such as Airbnb making their search bar have a suggestion
        instead of a typical search bar text. Another thing I learned is
        that designers have to go through multiple rounds and iterations
        to come to their final decisions concerning a product. </li>
        <li> My favorite part of the article was probably the GIFs 
        breaking down each section and hierarchy of the products. It made
        me think of the products in an analytical design perspective, 
        rather than a user. </li>
        <li> "Next time you're sitting in a Lyft or waiting on a friend, open up an app and think through the reasons why the designers chose to design it that way." </li>
        <li> 8 - It was a brief article that was straight to the point,
            and it covered some new approaches to getting better at design
            that weren't conventional and well-known. </li>
