					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from this article is that there are
								official ratings/grades that show how color accesible a certain
								color combination is to those who are visually impaired. I never
								realized there was a need to standardize contrast to make sure people
								can interpret design, but in retrospect it's very much needed now in our digital age,
								and considering that a large part of the population has a visual impairment.
								The contrast ratio and the W3C's AA rating was something new I learned and hope to implement
								in further designs. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the visuals and images that were included.
								They very clearly showed good examples of visual contrast and helped emphasize the points they were making.
								I also liked the top red bar on the top of header that showed your progress through the article. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Not creating accessible products is just rude, so donâ€™t be rude." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> 8.5 - I enjoyed this article a lot because I got to learn new information and design practices
								that are rarely touched upon/talked about in a traditional design class, and I now have resources to also
								put what I learned into practice.
